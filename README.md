# QuantQuant

A quantization method for neural networks based on quantiles in empirical distributions.

A final project for Harvard's CS 242, "Computing at Scale," taught by Prof. HT Kung.

This project was a collaboration with [Ralph Estanboulieh](https://github.com/RalphEST) and [Ryan Kim](https://github.com/rkhkim). My main contributions involve a significant portion of the code for application of quantization to neural networks, as well a large share of writing the paper.

Check out the [report](https://github.com/lukekenworthy/QuantQuant/blob/main/report.pdf), as well as the relevant [code](https://github.com/lukekenworthy/QuantQuant/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).
